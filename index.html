              <li>
                A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).

              JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different
              in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have
              Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most
              Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow
              constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to
              JavaScript.
            </p>
      
          
            <p>
              JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not
              have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to
              be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and
              you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and
              function return types are not explicitly typed.

            The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that use 
            the standard Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP) to serve billions of users worldwide. It is a 
            network of networks that consists of millions of private, public academic, business, and 
            government networks.

            The World Wide Web, abbreviated as WWW and commonly known as the Web, 
is a system of interlinked hypertext documents accessed via the Internet. With a web 
browser, one can view web pages that may contain text, images, videos, and other 
multimedia and navigate between them via hyperlinks. 
 </p>
          <p>
           <b>Emergence of Web: </b>
           <br><br>
           Between the summers of 1991 and 1994, the load on the first Web 
           server ("info.cern.ch") rose steadily by a factor of 10 every year. 
           In 1992 academia, and in 1993 industry, was taking notice. World Wide Web Consortium 
           is formed in September 1994, with a base at MIT is the USA, INRIA in France, and now 
           also at Keio University in Japan. 

          </p>
          <p>
            You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers.
            You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in
            identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and
            _name.
            With the dramatic flood of rich material of all kinds onto the Web in the 1990s, the first 
part of the dream is largely realized, although still very few people in practice have access 
to intuitive hypertext creation tools. 
The second part has yet to happen, but there are signs and plans which make us confident. 
The great need for information about information, to help us categorize, sort, pay for own 
information is driving the design of languages for the web designed for processing by 
machines, rather than people. The web of human readable document is being merged with 
a web of machine-understandable data. The potential of the mixture of humans and 
machines working together and communicating through the web could be immense.

             <b>WEB Servers: </b><br><br>

              To view and browse pages on the Web, all you need is a web browser. To 
publish pages on the Web, you need a web server. A web server is the program that runs 
on a computer and is responsible for replying to web browser requests for files. You need 
a web server to publish documents on the Web. When you use a browser to request a page 
on a website, that browser makes a web connection to a server using the HTTP protocol. 
The browser then formats the information it got from the server. Server accepts the 
connection, sends the contents of the requested files and then closes.

              <b>WEB Browsers:</b><br><br>
              A web browser is the program you use to view pages and navigate the World Wide Web. 
              A wide array of web browsers is available for just about every platform you can imagine. 
              Microsoft Internet Explorer, for example, is included with Windows and Safari is 
              included with Mac OS X. Mozilla Firefox, Netscape Navigator, and Opera are all 
              available for free. 
            </p>
      
            <p>
              <b>What the Browser Does </b>
              The core purpose of a web browser is to connect to web servers, 
request documents, and then properly format and display those documents. Web browsers 
can also display files on your local computer, download files that are not meant to be 
displayed. Each web page is a file written in a language called the Hypertext Markup 
Language (HTML) that includes the text of the page, a description of its structure, and 
links to other documents, images, or other media.

             <b> Protocols:</b>
             In computing, a protocol is a set of rules which is used by computers to 
communicate with each other across a network. A protocol is a convention or standard 
that controls or enables the connection, communication, and data transfer between 
computing endpoints.

            <p>
           <b>  Internet Protocol Suite:</b>
          The Internet Protocol Suite is the set of communications 
protocols used for the Internet and other similar networks. It is commonly also known as 
TCP/IP named from two of the most important protocols in it: The Transmission Control 
Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP), which were the first two networking 
protocols defined in this standard.
